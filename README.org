* Introduction

This is a file manager written using the Qt GUI framework leveraging the performance and robustness of C++.

* Why another file manager ?

The file managers for linux arenâ€™t that great for me. So I decided to write my own. And this one is inspired by the TUI (terminal UI) keyboard driven file managers like ranger, vifm, lf, yazi etc. I still use them, but I wanted to get past the limitations of the TUI compared to the GUI.

* Features

1. Display Images
2. Async file Operations
3. Keyboard driven
